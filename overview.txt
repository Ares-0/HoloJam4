Movement
    4 way movement
        8 is prob fine for now but idk not the visionTM
    long term would like to end on discrete squares
        I dont want to deal with the whole navigation stuff though
    collide into walls
    move down one ways
    slide down ramps (totally lose control)

    sliding -> while on the object (/tile?) you have a constant velocity in a direction













Script
Day 1
You woke up from an awful nightmare and decided to take a walk.
However, looking around, this world doesn't seem much better.
Fuzzy and out of focus, half formed, or rather, half gone.
I'll try to [][][][][] what I can (archive)

You come across a strange creature.



Ah, you know what this is. It's an oddity. A sprit, an aberration. Possibly a god.
What's more, you know something very important. 
1) This oddity is very real
2) This oddity is a figment of your imagination
