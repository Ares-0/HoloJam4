MVP Requirements
    Basic dialog system (one way)
    Fill out 3 paths
    Fill 3 paths with hazards
    "respawn" system
        safe areas?



Movement
    4 way movement
        8 is prob fine for now but idk not the visionTM
    long term would like to end on discrete squares
        I dont want to deal with the whole navigation stuff though
    collide into walls
    move down one ways
    slide down ramps (totally lose control)

    sliding -> while on the object (/tile?) you have a constant velocity in a direction



Major Checkpoints
    tilesets
    room transitions
    dialog system?
        interactive?



Tile stuff
    TODO: Need to see how well I can adjust the colors (programmatically)
    TODO: Scale looks wonky
    TODO: cliff side can be reversed, while technically following the rules

    Done
        Set up terrains for grass, sand, water, dark grass, cliff
        added collisions to water tiles
