        Tako eyes now follow player
        Fixed several bugs around the tako's yelling text

    Player movement:
        Added animation!
        Always uses most recent button press to choose direction
        Collision shape changed to capsule to slide around corners easier
        Added slight snapping to keep player on regular pixel intervals
    
    Sound:
        Added music! Changes depending on location and talisman placement

    Plot stuff
        Ability to return to main menu and then resume game where left off
        Replaced all plot advancement logic with a state machine
        Occasionally lock player on screen
        Small cooldown after interacting with something so very quick button presses are ignored
