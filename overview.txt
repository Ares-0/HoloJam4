    something glitches when switching to final scene
        I think its the world unspawning everything
            known issue, slotted for 4.3
    fix talisman numbering
    stop moving on quantized positions
    fix continue system
        door status and stuff?
    replace plot logic with state machine
    tako eyes left and right

Bug Tracker
    Possible to get stuck against takos and walls
        Probable from takos too close to the edge during screen transition clamping
    possible to have an extra talisman in the inventory during part 2
    tako text should be above takos
    I never randomized the tako text!
    After interacting, short time where can't reinteract

Stretch Goals
    mobs shake when angry
    walking animation
    lock first 4 inner talismans during day 1
    Camera zooms in very slightly during dialog
    Text splays out over time
    Avatars by box during dialog
    Lock player in room sometimes
    Some edgy filter on top of the game screen
    The paths you go on first are less mobbed, later paths more mobbed

Movement
    4 way movement
    collide into walls
    move down one ways
    slide down ramps (totally lose control)
    sliding -> while on the object (/tile?) you have a constant velocity in a direction

Tile stuff
    TODO: Need to see how well I can adjust the colors (programmatically)

    Done
        Set up terrains for grass, sand, water, dark grass, cliff
        added collisions to water tiles
        Splitting the 720p area into 15 tiles of 48px


Plot Layout
plot point number and the actions that cause the transitions

-3 - dialog test loop
-2 - debug with all doors off
-1 - debug
0 - new game
    wake up 1 (auto)
1a - player can move around the top area
    pick up talisman
1b - player can move around in the main area
    talk to oddity 1
2 - player can walk around in main area and 3 initial spokes
    pickup first talisman
    play that dialog
3 - same as 2 but that dialog is done now
    all talismans to center
    ending 1
4 - starting day 2
    wake up II (auto)
5 - player can walk around top area only (blocked by plot armor dab)
    pickup first talisman II
6 - player can walk around in the main area
    maybe can't pick up talismans from outer?
    talk to oddity II
7 - player can walk around the spokes
    all talismans to outer -> door opens in middle
8 - player can walk around the spokes
    return to center -> dialog
9 - player can walk around the spokes
    player goes through door
    ending 2
10 - done

notes
oddity probably has to bitch more at some point
