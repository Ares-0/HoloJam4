Bug Tracker
    Audiomanager is playing wrong music when returning to middle
    Audiomanager should maybe run while paused
    Freeze player movement after going through final door
    Can try to return to completed game
    Dialog box dialog is stretched / squashed
    Theres a way to press space and get movement stuck
    You can change the song by standing real close to the edge of the screen but not changing screens

    Possible to get stuck against takos and walls
        From takos too close to the edge during screen transition clamping
    possible to have an extra talisman in the inventory during part 2
    something glitches when switching to final scene
        I think its the world unspawning everything

Updates in v1.1:
    Judgemental takos:
        Tako eyes now follow player
        Fixed several bugs around the tako's yelling text
        Yelling text fades

    Player movement:
        Added animation!
        Always uses most recent button press to choose direction
        Collision shape changed to capsule to slide around corners easier
        Added slight snapping to keep player on regular pixel intervals
    
    Sound:
        Added music! Changes depending on location and talisman placement
        Added sound effects to a lot of things
            The tako wahs might be a bit much and a little goofy but they get across the experience I want them too

    Plot stuff
        Ability to return to main menu and then resume game where left off
        Replaced all plot advancement logic with a state machine
        Small cooldown after interacting with something so very quick button presses are ignored
        Moved true talisman dialog
        Added some guardrails to help keep players from getting on the wrong track
            Occasionally lock player on screen
            Keep players from putting talismans in unhelpful places

    UI
        Added keyboard focus to UI buttons
        Holding space advances dialog as well
        Options menu with audio sliders
