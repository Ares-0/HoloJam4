            known issue, slotted for 4.3

Bug Tracker
    Grass tiles too scruffy
    Continue Game does not store all necessary states?

Stretch Goals
    lock first 4 inner talismans during day 1
    Camera zooms in very slightly during dialog
    Text splays out over time
    Avatars by box during dialog
    Lock player in room sometimes
    Some edgy filter on top of the game screen
    The paths you go on first are less mobbed, later paths more mobbed

Movement
    4 way movement
    collide into walls
    move down one ways
    slide down ramps (totally lose control)
    sliding -> while on the object (/tile?) you have a constant velocity in a direction

2 - player can walk around in main area and 3 initial spokes
pickup first talisman
play that dialog

all talismans to center
ending 1
4 - starting day 2
wake up II (auto)
5 - player can walk around top area only (blocked by plot armor dab)
